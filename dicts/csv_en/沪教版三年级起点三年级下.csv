   the reason of anything; that on account of which a thing is or is done.
prep. Indicating the remoter and indirect object of an act; the
   end or final cause with reference to which anything is, acts, serves,
   or is done.
prep. Indicating that in favor of which, or in promoting which,
   anything is, or is done; hence, in behalf of; in favor of; on the side
   of; -- opposed to against.
prep. Indicating that toward which the action of anything is

prep. Indicating that on place of or instead of which anything

how old,none
noodle,n. a ribbonlike strip of pasta
to,"prep. The preposition to primarily indicates approach and arrival,
   motion made in the direction of a place or thing and attaining it,
   access; and also, motion or tendency without arrival; movement toward;
   -- opposed to from.
prep. Hence, it indicates motion, course, or tendency toward a
   time, a state or condition, an aim, or anything capable of being
   regarded as a limit to a tendency, movement, or action; as, he is going
   to a trade; he is rising to wealth and honor.
prep. In a very general way, and with innumerable varieties of
   application, to connects transitive verbs with their remoter or
   indirect object, and adjectives, nouns, and neuter or passive verbs
   with a following noun which limits their action. Its sphere verges upon
   that of for, but it contains less the idea of design or appropriation;
   as, these remarks were addressed to a large audience; let us keep this
   seat to ourselves; a substance sweet to the taste; an event painful to
   the mind; duty to God and to our parents; a dislike to spirituous
   liquor.
prep. As sign of the infinitive, to had originally the use of last
   defined, governing the infinitive as a verbal noun, and connecting it
   as indirect object with a preceding verb or adjective; thus, ready to
   go, i.e., ready unto going; good to eat, i.e., good for eating; I do my
   utmost to lead my life pleasantly. But it has come to be the almost
   constant prefix to the infinitive, even in situations where it has no
   prepositional meaning, as where the infinitive is direct object or
   subject; thus, I love to learn, i.e., I love learning; to die for one's
   country is noble, i.e., the dying for one's country. Where the
   infinitive denotes the design or purpose, good usage formerly allowed
   the prefixing of for to the to; as, what went ye out for see? (Matt.
   xi. 8).
prep. In many phrases, and in connection with many other words, to
   has a pregnant meaning, or is used elliptically.
prep. Extent; limit; degree of comprehension; inclusion as far as;
   as, they met us to the number of three hundred.
prep. Effect; end; consequence; as, the prince was flattered to
   his ruin; he engaged in a war to his cost; violent factions exist to
   the prejudice of the state.
prep. Apposition; connection; antithesis; opposition; as, they
   engaged hand to hand.
prep. Accord; adaptation; as, an occupation to his taste; she has
   a husband to her mind.

   it is ten to one that you will offend him.
prep. Addition; union; accumulation.
prep. Accompaniment; as, she sang to his guitar; they danced to
