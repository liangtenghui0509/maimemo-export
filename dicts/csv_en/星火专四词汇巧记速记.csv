of,"prep. In a general sense, from, or out from; proceeding from;
   belonging to; relating to; concerning; -- used in a variety of
   applications; as:
prep. Denoting that from which anything proceeds; indicating
   origin, source, descent, and the like; as, he is of a race of kings; he
   is of noble blood.
prep. Denoting possession or ownership, or the relation of subject
   to attribute; as, the apartment of the consul: the power of the king; a
   man of courage; the gate of heaven.
prep. Denoting the material of which anything is composed, or that
   which it contains; as, a throne of gold; a sword of steel; a wreath of
   mist; a cup of water.
prep. Denoting part of an aggregate or whole; belonging to a
   number or quantity mentioned; out of; from amongst; as, of this little
   he had some to spare; some of the mines were unproductive; most of the
   company.
prep. Denoting that by which a person or thing is actuated or
   impelled; also, the source of a purpose or action; as, they went of
   their own will; no body can move of itself; he did it of necessity.
prep. Denoting reference to a thing; about; concerning; relating
   to; as, to boast of one's achievements.
prep. Denoting nearness or distance, either in space or time;
   from; as, within a league of the town; within an hour of the appointed
   time.
prep. Denoting identity or equivalence; -- used with a name or
   appellation, and equivalent to the relation of apposition; as, the
   continent of America; the city of Rome; the Island of Cuba.
prep. Denoting the agent, or person by whom, or thing by which,

   the days of Herod.
prep. Denoting passage from one state to another; from.
prep. During; in the course of."
up,"v. raise
a. being or moving higher in position or greater in some value; being above a former position or level
s. extending or moving toward a higher place
s. (usually followed by `on' or `for') in readiness"
to,"prep. The preposition to primarily indicates approach and arrival,
   motion made in the direction of a place or thing and attaining it,
   access; and also, motion or tendency without arrival; movement toward;
   -- opposed to from.
prep. Hence, it indicates motion, course, or tendency toward a
   time, a state or condition, an aim, or anything capable of being
   regarded as a limit to a tendency, movement, or action; as, he is going
   to a trade; he is rising to wealth and honor.
prep. In a very general way, and with innumerable varieties of
   application, to connects transitive verbs with their remoter or
   indirect object, and adjectives, nouns, and neuter or passive verbs
   with a following noun which limits their action. Its sphere verges upon
   that of for, but it contains less the idea of design or appropriation;
   as, these remarks were addressed to a large audience; let us keep this
   seat to ourselves; a substance sweet to the taste; an event painful to
   the mind; duty to God and to our parents; a dislike to spirituous
   liquor.
prep. As sign of the infinitive, to had originally the use of last
   defined, governing the infinitive as a verbal noun, and connecting it
   as indirect object with a preceding verb or adjective; thus, ready to
   go, i.e., ready unto going; good to eat, i.e., good for eating; I do my
   utmost to lead my life pleasantly. But it has come to be the almost
   constant prefix to the infinitive, even in situations where it has no
   prepositional meaning, as where the infinitive is direct object or
   subject; thus, I love to learn, i.e., I love learning; to die for one's
   country is noble, i.e., the dying for one's country. Where the
   infinitive denotes the design or purpose, good usage formerly allowed
   the prefixing of for to the to; as, what went ye out for see? (Matt.
   xi. 8).
prep. In many phrases, and in connection with many other words, to
   has a pregnant meaning, or is used elliptically.
prep. Extent; limit; degree of comprehension; inclusion as far as;
   as, they met us to the number of three hundred.
prep. Effect; end; consequence; as, the prince was flattered to
   his ruin; he engaged in a war to his cost; violent factions exist to
   the prejudice of the state.
prep. Apposition; connection; antithesis; opposition; as, they
   engaged hand to hand.
prep. Accord; adaptation; as, an occupation to his taste; she has
   a husband to her mind.
prep. Comparison; as, three is to nine as nine is to twenty-seven;
   it is ten to one that you will offend him.
prep. Addition; union; accumulation.
prep. Accompaniment; as, she sang to his guitar; they danced to
   the music of a piano.
prep. Character; condition of being; purpose subserved or office
   filled."
