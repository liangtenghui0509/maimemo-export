shall,"v. i. & auxiliary. To owe; to be under obligation for.
v. i. & auxiliary. To be obliged; must.
v. i. & auxiliary. As an auxiliary, shall indicates a duty or
   necessity whose obligation is derived from the person speaking; as, you
   shall go; he shall go; that is, I order or promise your going. It thus
   ordinarily expresses, in the second and third persons, a command, a
   threat, or a promise. If the auxillary be emphasized, the command is
   made more imperative, the promise or that more positive and sure. It is
   also employed in the language of prophecy; as, ""the day shall come when
   . . . , "" since a promise or threat and an authoritative prophecy
   nearly coincide in significance. In shall with the first person, the
   necessity of the action is sometimes implied as residing elsewhere than
   in the speaker; as, I shall suffer; we shall see; and there is always a
   less distinct and positive assertion of his volition than is indicated
   by will. ""I shall go"" implies nearly a simple futurity; more exactly, a
   foretelling or an expectation of my going, in which, naturally enough,
   a certain degree of plan or intention may be included; emphasize the
   shall, and the event is described as certain to occur, and the
   expression approximates in meaning to our emphatic ""I will go."" In a
   question, the relation of speaker and source of obligation is of course
   transferred to the person addressed; as, ""Shall you go?"" (answer, ""I
   shall go""); ""Shall he go?"" i. e., ""Do you require or promise his
   going?"" (answer, ""He shall go"".) The same relation is transferred to
   either second or third person in such phrases as ""You say, or think,
   you shall go;"" ""He says, or thinks, he shall go."" After a conditional
   conjunction (as if, whether) shall is used in all persons to express
   futurity simply; as, if I, you, or he shall say they are right. Should
   is everywhere used in the same connection and the same senses as shall,
   as its imperfect. It also expresses duty or moral obligation; as, he
   should do it whether he will or not. In the early English, and hence in
   our English Bible, shall is the auxiliary mainly used, in all the
   persons, to express simple futurity. (Cf. Will, v. t.) Shall may be
   used elliptically; thus, with an adverb or other word expressive of
   motion go may be omitted."

to,"prep. The preposition to primarily indicates approach and arrival,
   motion made in the direction of a place or thing and attaining it,
   access; and also, motion or tendency without arrival; movement toward;
   -- opposed to from.

   time, a state or condition, an aim, or anything capable of being
   regarded as a limit to a tendency, movement, or action; as, he is going
   to a trade; he is rising to wealth and honor.
prep. In a very general way, and with innumerable varieties of
   application, to connects transitive verbs with their remoter or
   indirect object, and adjectives, nouns, and neuter or passive verbs
   with a following noun which limits their action. Its sphere verges upon
   that of for, but it contains less the idea of design or appropriation;
   as, these remarks were addressed to a large audience; let us keep this
   seat to ourselves; a substance sweet to the taste; an event painful to
   the mind; duty to God and to our parents; a dislike to spirituous
   liquor.
prep. As sign of the infinitive, to had originally the use of last
   defined, governing the infinitive as a verbal noun, and connecting it
   as indirect object with a preceding verb or adjective; thus, ready to
   go, i.e., ready unto going; good to eat, i.e., good for eating; I do my
   utmost to lead my life pleasantly. But it has come to be the almost
   constant prefix to the infinitive, even in situations where it has no
   prepositional meaning, as where the infinitive is direct object or
   subject; thus, I love to learn, i.e., I love learning; to die for one's
   country is noble, i.e., the dying for one's country. Where the
   infinitive denotes the design or purpose, good usage formerly allowed
   the prefixing of for to the to; as, what went ye out for see? (Matt.
   xi. 8).
prep. In many phrases, and in connection with many other words, to
   has a pregnant meaning, or is used elliptically.
prep. Extent; limit; degree of comprehension; inclusion as far as;
   as, they met us to the number of three hundred.
prep. Effect; end; consequence; as, the prince was flattered to
   his ruin; he engaged in a war to his cost; violent factions exist to
   the prejudice of the state.
prep. Apposition; connection; antithesis; opposition; as, they
   engaged hand to hand.
prep. Accord; adaptation; as, an occupation to his taste; she has

quote ... unquote,"A horribly incorrect way of citing a particular phrase or adding emphasis to a questionable term. Typically it preceeds the phrase and is accompanied by a stupid little fang finger gesture. If you currently use the term ""quote unquote"" (and especially if you do the finger thing) please stop it now. Don't feel bad. It's an understandable mistake because the idiots on Fox News say it all the time as does your boss at work, most probably. But read on...

First of all, it should be QUOTE and ENDQUOTE. These are the official names for the double apostrophe symbols ("") on your keyboard.

Secondly, the proper syntax is to say QUOTE, followed by the phrase, closed by ENDQUOTE.

CORRECT USAGE (spoken):
What do you think of Bush's quote War on Terror endquote?

means:
What do you think of Bush's ""War on Terror?""

INCORRECT USAGE (spoken):
What do you think of Bush's quote unquote War on Terror?

means:
What do you think of Bush's """"War on Terror?

Get it? Good. But try to avoid saying it altogether. Using the phrase ""so-called"" is much more acceptable. Example:
What do you think of Bush's so-called War on Terror?
> (Incorrect but common usage)
> BOSS: Ok people, let's get proactive. This is a win-win situation. So give it 110% and quote unquote kick some ass!
> EMPLOYEE: Man, you're such a putz.
